Installation Instructions
*************************

Requirements
============

Wallaroo relies on a few of Boost libraries. You can donwload the
latest version from www.boost.org, extract it wherever you want
and include its path when compiling your application that use Wallaroo.
Since Wallaroo uses header-only boost libraries, you don't need to compile
boost.

If you use a C++0x compliant compiler, you need Boost only to exploit
XmlWiringFile features.

Installation
============

Wallaroo library is header-only: it consists entirely of header files 
containing templates and inline functions, and require no separately-compiled 
library binaries or special treatment when linking.

Extract the archive wherever you want.
This is a sketch of the resulting directory structure:

wallaroo\ ....................................The “wallaroo root directory”
   README .............................Generic documentation about wallaroo
   INSTALL ......................................Installation documentation
   ChangeLog ........................................The log of the changes
   Version ...........................This file contains the version number
   wallaroo\ .....................................All Wallaroo Header files
   samples\ ..............................................Examples and test
      mineplant\ ..........The "originating" example from Carlo Pescio blog
      minimal\..............................................A basic example
      xmlfile\...................................Usage of a xml wiring file
      cpp0x\........................This example use C++0x instead of boost
      ...more samples...
   test\ ......... Automatic tests of the library (for wallaroo developers)
   doc\ ..................................A subset of Wallaroo library docs

Now you must only remember to insert the wallaroo path when 
compiling your source code.
If you are using a compiler that doesn't support C++0x, or if you plan to
use the "XmlWiringFile" feature, you must also include the Boost Libraries
path.

Usage
=====

To build your own project, the compiler needs to know the include path of 
the boost and wallaroo libraries.

So, if you use gcc, you can use the following syntax:
	g++ -I<boost_path> -I<wallaroo_path> *.cpp -o <app_exe>
    
or:
	g++ -std=c++0x -I<wallaroo_path> *.cpp -o <app_exe>

It's important to note the following:

The path to the wallaroo root directory (often C:\Program Files\wallaroo) is 
sometimes referred to as $WALLAROO_ROOT in documentation and mailing lists.

To compile anything in Wallaroo, you need a directory containing the wallaroo\ 
subdirectory in your #include path.

Since all of Wallaroo's header files have the .h extension, and live in the 
wallaroo\ subdirectory of the wallaroo root, your Wallaroo #include directives 
will look like:
  #include <wallaroo/whatever.h>
or
  #include "wallaroo/whatever.h"
depending on your preference regarding the use of angle bracket includes. 
Even Windows users can (and, for portability reasons, probably should) use 
forward slashes in #include directives; your compiler doesn't care.


Compilation of the samples
==========================

You can find some examples in the directory samples. Each example comes with:
* makefile
* scons file
* visual studio 2008 solution file
* visual studio 2010 solution file

All methods require you to specify the boost library path. You can do it in
the following ways:

* Make
        make UCFLAGS=-I<boost_path>
    example:
        make UCFLAGS=-I/opt/boost_1_50_0/

* Scons
        scons incpath=<boost_path>
    example:
        scons incpath=/opt/boost_1_50_0/

* Visual Studio
    You must set the environment variable BOOST.

Compilation of the Doxygen documentation
========================================
If you have doxygen installed on your system, you can get the html documentation
of the libraryin this way:
    <enter the directory doc>
    doxygen Doxyfile
