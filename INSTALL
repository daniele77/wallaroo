Installation
============

Wallaroo library is header-only: it consists entirely of header files 
containing templates and inline functions, and require no separately-compiled 
library binaries or special treatment when linking.

Extract the archive wherever you want.
This is a sketch of the resulting directory structure:

wallaroo\ ....................................The “wallaroo root directory”
   README .............................Generic documentation about wallaroo
   INSTALL ......................................Installation documentation
   ChangeLog ........................................The log of the changes
   Version ...........................This file contains the version number
   wallaroo\ .....................................All Wallaroo Header files
   samples\ ..............................................Examples and test
      mineplant\ ..........The "originating" example from Carlo Pescio blog
      minimal\..............................................A basic example
      ...more samples...
   doc\ ..................................A subset of Wallaroo library docs

Now you must only remember to insert the wallaroo path when compiling your 
source code.

Usage
=====

It's important to note the following:

The path to the wallaroo root directory (often C:\Program Files\wallaroo) is 
sometimes referred to as $WALLAROO_ROOT in documentation and mailing lists.

To compile anything in Wallaroo, you need a directory containing the wallaroo\ 
subdirectory in your #include path.

Since all of Wallaroo's header files have the .h extension, and live in the 
wallaroo\ subdirectory of the wallaroo root, your Wallaroo #include directives 
will look like:
  #include <wallaroo/whatever.h>
or
  #include "wallaroo/whatever.h"
depending on your preference regarding the use of angle bracket includes. 
Even Windows users can (and, for portability reasons, probably should) use 
forward slashes in #include directives; your compiler doesn't care.
